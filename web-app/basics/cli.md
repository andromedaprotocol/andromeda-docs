# CLI

### Introduction

Andromeda aims to be a unifier of the Cosmos, meaning the Andromeda ecosystem will be available on most, if not all, Cosmos chains. We are looking to eliminate the burden and inconvenience for developers that want to develop using the Andromeda ecosystem to have to learn every deployment method of each chain in order to interact with our ADOs.\
\
To solve this problem, we have built the Andromeda CLI. The CLI is an all encompassing tool to allow users quick and easy interaction with any of the chains that Andromeda is deployed on. You can check out what chains Andromeda is deployed on by going [here](https://docs.andromedaprotocol.io/andromeda/andromeda-cli/introduction#deployed-chains).

### Features

The main features offered by the Andromeda CLI are the following:

* Generating keys and maintaining wallets
* Swapping between chains
* Building and deploying ADOs to chain
* Executing and querying ADOs

### Installation

The CLI can be downloaded using our [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@andromedaprotocol/cli) or by running the following command in your terminal:

<pre><code><strong>sudo npm install -g @andromedaprotocol/cli
</strong></code></pre>

Once the package has been installed, you can run “andr” in the terminal to open the CLI:

If interested in working with our CLI or having issues with installation, please make sure to check out our full [CLI documentation](https://docs.andromedaprotocol.io/andromeda/andromeda-cli/introduction) where we go over every command available.
