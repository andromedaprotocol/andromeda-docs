# App Builder

Similar to the ADO Builder, the App Builder is a no-code builder that allows users to create Andomeda Apps. The App Builder unifies all the interfaces into one central interface that has all the functionality a user needs to build. Using shortcuts, templates, cross-ADO connections and much more, the App Builder makes building apps a seemless process.&#x20;

Andromeda ADOs are built to work together. This allows the users to build large complex applications with many connections between the various parts. The App Builder helps visualize the app workflow by showing the connections between each of the ADOs:
