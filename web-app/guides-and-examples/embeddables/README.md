# Embeddables

## Building An Embeddable: A General Overview <a href="#ok8t1bh7enzj" id="ok8t1bh7enzj"></a>

In our [ADO Builder examples](../../basics/ado-builder.md), we have covered the basics of building an Andromeda Application from scratch. Now we will be taking a look into embeddables, our easy to use front-end interfaces that provide a face to your app.&#x20;

Although they are slightly simplistic interfaces, they provide you with the following features:

* Wallet connection for users looking to use your App
* Ability to trigger actions on the app (Example bid on an NFT)
* Information and data retrieval for your App
