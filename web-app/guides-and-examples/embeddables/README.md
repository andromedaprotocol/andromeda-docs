# Embeddables

## Building An Embeddable: A General Overview <a href="#ok8t1bh7enzj" id="ok8t1bh7enzj"></a>

In our [ADO Builder examples](../../introduction/ado-builder.md), we have covered the basics of building an Andromeda Application from scratch. Now we will be taking a look into embeddables, our easy to use front-end interfaces that provide a face to your app.&#x20;

Although they are slightly simplistic interfaces, they provide you with the following features:

* Wallet connection for users looking to use your App
* Ability to trigger actions on the app (Example bid on an NFT)
* Information and data retrieval for your App

### Benefits of Embeddables <a href="#wlwom5a2wigo" id="wlwom5a2wigo"></a>

* **Plug-and-Play**: Embed a widget onto your website with your content using minimal coding.
* **Customizable:** Adjust to match your website's aesthetics with the design tools. (Coming Soon)
* **Versatile:** Suitable for auctions, marketplaces, crowdfunding, and other Apps that you create.

In the next examples, we will be looking at some examples of using an embeddable with one of your Andromeda Applications.

### Creating Your Own Embeddables

Although our embeddables page contains several ready to go interfaces for our most common applications, we cannot create an embeddable for every single use case that can be built using the aOS as the number in infinite. For this reason, we have created an embeddable starting template for developers looking to develop their own custom embeddables. The template can be found here:

{% embed url="https://github.com/andromedaprotocol/andromeda-nextjs-application-starter?tab=readme-ov-file" %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Creating a custom embeddable will require knowledge of Next.js and typescript.
{% endhint %}
