# The Token Standards

## Introduction

The Cosmos ecosystem has gained significant traction in the blockchain space due to its interoperability features and focus on scalability. As part of its growing ecosystem, Cosmos has developed two primary token standards: **CW721** and **CW20**. These standards facilitate the creation and management of both non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens (Coins) within the Cosmos network, enabling developers to build a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets.

Most of the use cases we will be building in the [**Guides and Examples**](broken-reference) sections will contain one of the above mentioned tokens as the base component of the dApp.
