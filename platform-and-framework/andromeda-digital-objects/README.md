In many ways, you can think of an ADO as a file. It has an owner, properties, functionality, and possibly value. Whether its a financial position, such as a loan or a position in a liquidity pool, it can be reflected as an ADO in the system. Or an NFT. Or a time locked staking position with a validator.
