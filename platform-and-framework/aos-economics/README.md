# aOS Economics

After 30+ years, we know Open Source Software works. It has provided the world with crazy-amazing amounts of value that every single organization on the planet benefits from directly. Every application on your phone, every cash register, smart home device, etc. uses open source software.

There's just one problem - the value created by open source developers wasn't passed on to the developers. It was largely done as a labor of love combined with a love for engineering and solving problems.

AndromedaOS has implemented a system for recouping developer and platform maintenance fees on behalf of the developer. The system is designed to recover remuneration for developers' effort, promote open source development, and make the Operating System sustainable.

We feel like this is what guys like [Eric S. Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric\_S.\_Raymond) and [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard\_Stallman) would have done, had they had the ability to integrate economics alongside OSS.
