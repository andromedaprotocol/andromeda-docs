# aOS File System

Moving beyond confusing and scary hashes is the next logical step in making web3 easier better and faster. Keeping track of your assets, positions, data, etc through a ubiquitous namespace is absolutely required to move forward.

### System Directory Layout

* [/etc](etc.md) - used for aOS configs for the particular chain
* [/bin](bin.md) - used for system/user ADOs
* [/lib](lib.md) - shared code between ADOs or Apps
* [/home](home.md) - Each user has a _home_ directory for their assets
* [/group](group.md) - group/shared assets, can be home for DAOs
* [/svc](svc.md) - end points for traditional blockchain applications
