# ADO Versions

To ensure developers always have access to the right information for their needs, ADO documentation is structured into three categories based on the version and deployment status of the ADO.

## Main Docs

The Main Docs contain the documentation for the latest stable version of each ADO. These ADOs have been fully tested and deployed on mainnet and testnet, ensuring they are production-ready and safe to use. Developers looking for official, battle-tested implementations should refer to this version.

📌 Deployment: ✅ Mainnet | ✅ Testnet

## Beta Docs (Latest Beta Version)

{% hint style="warning" %}
&#x20;ADOs that are Beta are tagged with `-beta` in the ADO version.
{% endhint %}

The Beta Docs provide documentation for the latest beta versions of ADOs, which are still undergoing testing and improvements. While these versions may offer new features and enhancements, they are not yet considered fully stable.

📌 Deployment: ✅ Testnet | ⚠️ Possibly Mainnet&#x20;

## Archived Docs

The Archived Docs store documentation for older versions of ADOs. They remain available for reference in case older applications still rely on them.
