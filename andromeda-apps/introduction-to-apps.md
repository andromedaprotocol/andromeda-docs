# Introduction to Apps

### Andromeda Apps

Andromeda is a central hub for building fully decentralized web-3 Apps in the Cosmos ecosystem. To do so, we have created the App ADO which groups all the different ADOs needed for a dApp under one ADO. This facilitates the organization of the project and the communication between the different parts.&#x20;

### Features

1. Fully decentralized dApps
2. Instantiate all of the ADOs with one go
3. Use our custom name-spacing system to integrate and connect ADOs
4. Interact with the entire dApp and ADOs from one source
5. Easily customize permissioning and ownership of all ADOs

### What's Next ?

In the next sections, we will be going through some examples on building and deplying an Andromda App from scratch. We will go through a variety of popular dApps that can be built using Andromeda. Keep in mind that these are only a very few use cases out of thousands that can be built.&#x20;
