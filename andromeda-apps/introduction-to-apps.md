# Introduction to Apps

### Andromeda Apps

Andromeda is a central hub for building fully decentralized web-3 Apps in the Cosmos ecosystem. To do so, we have created the App ADO which groups all the different ADOs needed for a dApp under one ADO. This facilitates the organization of the project and the communication between the different parts.&#x20;

### Features

1. Fully decentralized dApps
2. Instantiate all of the ADOs with one go
3. Use our custom name-spacing system to integrate and connect ADOs
4. Interact with the entire dApp and ADOs from one source
5. Easily customize permissioning and ownership of all ADOs

### Andromeda CLI

We will be building the Apps using the [Andromeda CLI](broken-reference), so make sure you have it dowloaded. If not you can grab the latest version by running:

```
sudo npm i -g @andromedaprotocol/cli
```

We will be building all our examples using our [wasm commands](../andromeda-cli/wasm.md):

* wasm instantiate
* wasm execute
* wasm query

All of the builds can be performed using our [ado commands](../andromeda-cli/ado.md) which would prompt you to fill in the messages field by field. Feel free to experiment and build any of the use cases the way you find easiest.&#x20;

### What's Next ?

In the next sections, we will be going through some examples on building and deploying an Andromda App from scratch using the Andromeda CLI. We will go through a variety of popular dApps that can be built using Andromeda. Keep in mind that these are only a very few use cases out of the thousands that can be built.&#x20;
