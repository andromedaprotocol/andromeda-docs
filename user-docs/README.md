{% hint style="info" %}
It is important to note that given the highly customizable nature of Andromeda Protocol, the guides can lean towards vagueness as the uniqueness and capability of your ADO is only limited by your imagination. How you construct your specific ADO will be how it functions; this guide is only to give you examples and potential use cases for various Primitives and Modules.
