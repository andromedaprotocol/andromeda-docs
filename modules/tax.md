# Tax

This module defines a tax payment that will be attached to any **agreed** ADO transfers undertaken within the contract. **This payment is not required when the owner of the ADO is executing a transfer and is only required on an agreed transfer.** **Any rounding caused by the module favours the tax receiver.**

Any payments generated by the module will be recorded in the response event and are **added to the agreed transfer amount**. A separate payment will be generated for each receiver and will be the same amount for each receiver and not divided amongst them.

| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rate      | Rate         | The amount to be paid to each receiver upon an agreed transfer. See more [here](https://docs.andromedaprotocol.io/andromeda/modules#rates). |
| receivers | Vec\<String> | An address list of recipients for the royalty fee                                                                                           |

## Methods

### `calculate_fee`

Used to calculate the required payment for a given amount. **Returns a `Coin` fee amount.**

```rust
pub fn calculate_fee(&self, payment: Coin) -> Coin {
    let fee_amount = payment
        .amount
        .multiply_ratio(Uint128::from(self.fee), 100 as u128);

    coin(fee_amount.u128(), payment.denom)
}
```

| ------- | ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| payment | Coin | The amount to calculate the fee against |

## Hooks

The Tax module implements the following hooks:

### `on_agreed_transfer`

Used to append the required tax payments to the agreed transfer payments.

```rust
fn on_agreed_transfer(
    &self,
    deps: &DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    env: Env,
    payments: &mut Vec<BankMsg>,
    owner: String,
    purchaser: String,
    amount: Coin,
) -> StdResult<bool> {
    let fee_payment = self.calculate_fee(amount);
    for receiver in self.receivers.to_vec() {
        deduct_payment(payments, owner.clone(), fee_payment.clone())?;
        add_payment(payments, receiver, fee_payment.clone());
    }

    Ok(true)
}
```

## Validation

The Tax module does not have any validation requirements.
