# Overview

### Mission

**Andromeda** **Protocol** is a rapid development framework and a next-generation user interface that brings an Easier, Better, and Faster capability to Web 3.0, the blockchain industry.

### Andromeda Digital Objects (ADOs)

At their core, these ADOs are a collection of smart contracts that have been designed to work together and are built for scalable interoperability and updating.

Standalone, these contracts serve one strict purpose or none at all, but when combined with other ADOs, they can achieve endless utility. This is where our Apps come into play. Andromeda technology allows bundling multiple ADOs in one App contract to build the project the user desires. All of this and more will be available to do on a friendly user interface with a few clicks.

We have a very wide variety of ADOs that are expanding on the daily, from very simple escrows to complex Defi contracts.

#### What is the benefit of using ADOs

* **For Projects:**

Before **Andromeda**, projects would need to hire a full development teams in order to  build their projects and custom smart contracts. Andromeda eliminates this need by providing a very large amount of custom smart contracts that upcoming projects can pick and chose from to achieve their desired utility. These projects can then use our **No-Code-Builder** to build their projects in a matter of minutes.

* **For Developers:**

Developers can use our **Andromeda Logic Library** (ALL) which contains all our contracts to build from. Similar to how [**cw-plus**](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus) contracts are used as a base for production quality builds, the ALL will act as a base for all developers to create their own ADOs that use the superior interoperable system.&#x20;

As it stands, the ALL contains around 25 ADOs which is the tip of the iceberg. More and more ADOs are being added by the Andromeda dev team weekly and as we continue building the ALL will eventually reach a state with thousands of ADOs where every use case imagined can be built with the ALL.
