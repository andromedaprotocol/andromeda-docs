# Introduction to AndromedaOS

### What is a blockchain operating system?

In short, a blockchain operating system provides an environment filled with ready to use tooling, common interfaces for applications and features familiar to modern computer users. As Andromeda is the first true operating system designed to run on distributed computing frameworks, the details are quite technical.

AndromedaOS, or _aOS_ for short, is comprised of several interoperating systems that work together to bring clarity and ease of use to the user. It's important to understand the basic concepts and architecture of the system to develop.

A quick description of each of the components mentioned above:

* [Andromeda Digital Objects](broken-reference) - the building blocks of the system
* [Andromeda Apps](platform-and-framework/andromeda-apps/) - advanced functionality built with ADOs
* [aOS Kernel](platform-and-framework/aos-kernel.md) - the system for enforcing and coordinating the different systems
* [aOS File System](platform-and-framework/aos-file-system/) - common namespace for referencing ADOs, services, network, etc
* [aOS Users & Groups](platform-and-framework/aos-users-and-groups.md) - a more complex system for abstracted identity
* [aOS Networking](platform-and-framework/aos-networking.md) - easy to reference services cross-chain natively
* [aOS Economics](platform-and-framework/aos-economics/) - developer and creator incentives

It's important to note that each of these systems exist 100% on-chain. All logic, interactions, objects, economics, etc. are deployed on-chain. While the interfaces, wallets, key management, and other parts do remain off-chain for obvious reasons, the entirety of the AndromedaOS is on-chain.

### Powered by the Cosmos Ecosystem

The power and performance of the Rust/CosmWasm combo is what allowed this breakthrough in interoperability and complexity.
