# Clients

The Andromeda.js library enables users to interact with ADOs across different blockchains where Andromeda is deployed. However, each chain has its own set of unique features and requirements, making it necessary to create custom clients to enable seamless interaction with ADOs across all supported chains.

Currently, we have the following clients:

* [**ChainClient**](chainclient.md): A generic interface for interacting with any Cosmos chain.
* [**BaseChainClient**](basechainclient.md): A base class that extends the other clients.
* [**CosmClient:**](cosmclient.md) A client to interact with the cosmos hub chain.
* [**InjectiveClient:**](injectiveclient.md) A client to interact with the Injective chain.
* [**TerraClient:**](terraclient.md) A client to interact with the Terra chain.
* [**AndromedaClient:**](andromedaclient.md) A client to interact with the Andromeda chain.
* [ArchwayClient](archwayclient.md): A client to interact with the Archway chain.
